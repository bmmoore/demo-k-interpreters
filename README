This repository contains handwritten interpreters
corresponding to a simple language defined in
the K framework, http://www.kframework.org .
Interpreters are written in SML, O'Caml, Haskell, and Maude.

The Makefile will compile all files that need to be compiled.
(You can remove programs from the first line if you are
missing some compilers)

To compare with the performance of language implemnetations,
there are also direct translations of the example program
into Python, lua(for 5.3 and luajit 2), and C,
as well as some of the languages mentioned above.
